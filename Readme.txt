Spy and Guard simulation.

Red capsule is the Spy

Blue capsules are the guards.

The spy's objective is to make it to the computer and steal the files and then get to the exit again.

Simulation will reset on Spy getting caught and on spy reaching the exit point with the item.

At the start of every simulation the doors will randomly be open or closed and this determines the guard's path.

The item location is randomly decided at the start of the simulation.
